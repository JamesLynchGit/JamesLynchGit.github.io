					Masters Degree in Primary Education •
					Hibernia College • Dublin 05/2020
					<h/3>
					<p>
					In May 2020, I graduated with second class honours from the PMEP. This two-year intensive masters program
					comprised in-depth theoretical study, a research dissertation and 24 weeks of school placement. My dissertation
					explored the issue of gender imbalance within the primary education sector. Throughout the placement blocks, I gained
					invaluable experience in planning, preparing and teaching lessons to children of all levels and needs.

					<h3>
					BA (Hons) - Commercial Modern Music • DIT • Dublin, County Dublin • 05/2016
					</h3>
				
					<p>
					I studied at DIT for four years to graduate with a 2:1 in Commercial Modern Music. In studying a music degree, I gained
					the confidence to speak/perform in front of audiences of all sizes. In my final year research project, I investigated
					different theories relating to linguistic variation in sung speech. The commercial aspect of the music industry was also a
					key area of study on this course.

					Supply Teacher • St Joseph's CBS Primary School • Drogheda, County Louth • 01/2022 - Present
					<h/3>
				
					<p>
					As a supply teacher in Drogheda, I am required to work in many schools with classes of all ages and needs. Preparation of
					content and resources is key in this role as I can be asked to teach a lesson to any group at any time at very short notice.
					However, classroom management is the skill I have developed most in this role. I am regularly introduced to new and
					varied groups of children. It is important to be able to maintain discipline and motivate these children while keeping an
					engaging, respectful and fun atmosphere in the classroom. I believe my competency in this area is the reason for my
					longevity on the highly turned over Drogheda supply panel.

					Class Teacher • Duleek Girls National School • Drogheda, County Louth • 10/2020 - 08/2021
					</h3>
			
					<p>
					During my time at Duleek GNS, I relished the opportunity to work to be able to explore innovative methodologies and
					content from across the broad primary curriculum. A dynamic, interactive approach to teaching history, art and science,
					with integration of ICT, bore particularly fruitful results in my classroom. The challenge of Covid-19 presented an
					opportunity to embrace digital skills in a rapidly changing and unfamiliar teaching environment.

					English Teacher • NED Training Centre • County Dublin • 09/2016 - 01/2019
					</h3>
			
					<p>
					At NED Training Centre I had the opportunity to work in a modern, welcoming language school and gained valuable
					classroom experience working with adults. Within this role, I learned much regarding classroom management,
					leadership, organisation, planning and communication. These are all transferable skills which were of great value in
					making the transition to the primary school classroom.
